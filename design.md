Stuff to do list:

- Get melee attacks working for the boarding ship
- Make the explosion fluid deal damage instead of simply being there.
- In fact, explosion fluid should deal _all_ the AoE damage.
- Make ships a bit smaller to support larger levels
- Add win and loss conditions.
- Make ships wrap around the map.
